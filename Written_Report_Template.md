#**Kickstarting with Excel**

##*Overview of Project*
This project is designed to help Louise decide on what campaign or campaigns to focus on which will have the maximum rate of funding success through data analytics. 

###*Purpose*
Using the data that was accumulated, we're going to find out what projects have the highest success rate in funding throughout the years, and help Louise hone in on those successfully funded projects.

##*Analysis and Challenges*
First of all, there is a lot of data that was accumulated. One of the biggest challenges was to sort through this data to make it readable and, for lack of better words, make it make sense. Filtering out the outliers was also a challenge because there was quite a bit of them. In my opinion, the best way to tackle this project is to filter the projects based on Launch Date, Goals, and Successful Funding.

###*Analysis and Conclusions of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*
Based on the data filtered to outcomes of projects in relation to launch dates, May has the highest ratio of successful projects to failed projects. In my professional opinion, this is the best month to launch a project. Moreover, December's launch success and failure are almost equal, and I would avoid launching a project on this month.

###*Analysis and Conclusions of Outcomes Based on Goals*
Based on the data filtered to show the outcomes of projects in relation to funding goals, the goal ranges of <$1,000, and between $35,000-$44,999 have the highest success rate. In my professional opionion, these two price ranges will give you the best chance to get your project funded. However, I would avoid the goal ranges of $25,000-$39,999 and $45,000 or more since the highest success rate seen in these ranges is 27%.

###*Challenges and Difficulties Encountered*
I did not have any challenges or difficulties encountered on this project. However, in the future, I think there's a better software or code to use for better data manipulation and analysis.
